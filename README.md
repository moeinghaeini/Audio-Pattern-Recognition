# Audio-Pattern-Recognition

This repository contains the project developed for the MSc course **Audio Pattern Recognition** offered by the University of Milan.  
ðŸ“˜ Course Link: [Audio Pattern Recognition - UniMi](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2025/audio-pattern-recognition)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the application of audio signal processing and machine learning techniques to recognize and classify patterns in audio data. The objective is to gain practical experience in:

- Preprocessing audio signals
- Feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral features)
- Classification models (e.g., SVMs, k-NN, Neural Networks)
- Evaluation metrics and model comparison

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- **Python** (with libraries like `librosa`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`)
- **Signal Processing** fundamentals
- **Supervised Learning** for audio classification
- **Spectrogram Analysis**
